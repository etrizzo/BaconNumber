<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In class, we have been discussing how Graph structures might can be used to
represent relationships between groups of objects.  For this assignment,
you will be writing a program that allows you to play the 
"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon">Kevin Bacon Game</a>".
A person's "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon_number#Bacon_numbers">Bacon Number</a>" is computed based on the number of
movies of separation between that person and the actor Kevin Bacon.  For
example, if you are Kevin Bacon, then your Bacon Number is 0.  If you were
in a movie with Kevin Bacon, your number would be 1.  If you weren't in a
movie with Kevin Bacon, but were in a movie with someone who was, your
Bacon Number would be 2.  In short, your Bacon Number is one greater than
the smallest Bacon Number of any of your co-stars.
</p>

<p>
Note that this is a take off of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdos_number">Erdos numbers</a> <!---(mine's
3)--->, and the two can be combined to form the more elusive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdos-Bacon_number">Erdos-Bacon
    number</a>.
</p>

<p>
    For fun and some additional background, you can try out the <a href="http://oracleofbacon.org/">Oracle of Bacon</a> at the University of Virginia.
</p>

<h2>Program Details</h2>
<p>
You will be writing a class called <tt>BaconNumber</tt> that will read a data
file and allow you to interactively query the system for the Bacon Number
and path for any actor in the database.  The program should require a single
argument which is the filename containing the information on people and the
roles they played in a movie.  An optional second argument can be used to
specify the initial center.  After reading in the data, the program
should then prompt the user for commands until an end-of-file (CTRL-D) is
reached (<code>hasNextLine()</code> will return false).
</p>

<p>
Similar to what you did in past labs, if the filename argument begins with
"http:" you should treat it as an URL and read the file from the network.  This
will enable you to play the game without having to download the entire file.
To open a 
<a href="http://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~gr151/jdk-1.6/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html">Scanner</a>
from an URL, you just need to do something similar to the following:
</p>
<pre class="boxed code prettyprint lang-java">Scanner s = new Scanner( new URL("http://www.cs.oberlin.edu/").openStream() );
</pre>

<h3>Sample command line usage</h3>
<pre>% <span class="typed">java -Xmx2g BaconNumber imdb.full.txt</span> 
        
    # plays the game with the full data set centered at "Kevin Bacon (I)"

% <span class="typed">java -Xmx2g BaconNumber imdb.pre1950.txt "Bela Lugosi"</span> 

    # plays the game with the center set to "Bela Lugosi"

% <span class="typed">java -Xmx2g BaconNumber http://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~gr151/imdb/imdb.no-tv-v.txt</span> 
        
    # plays the game with the no TV/V data set centered at "Kevin Bacon (I)" 
</pre>
<!--

% <span class="typed">java -Xmx2g BaconNumber</span> 
        
    # plays the game using "http://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~gr151/imdb/imdb.no-tv-v.txt" centered at "Kevin Bacon (I)" 
-->

<h3>File Format</h3>
<p>
The movie data file contains information on what movies a performer appears
in.  Every line contains information on one person appearing in one movie.
The lines are formatted as follows:
</p>

<pre>    &lt;performer name&gt;|&lt;movie title&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The vertical pipe character '|' can be used to determine where the name
ends and the title begins.  There will only be one '|' on a line and there
are no empty names or titles. <a href="http://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~gr151/jdk-1.6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html">java.lang.String</a> has a number of methods that can
be used to divide up the line. (e.g., <code>split("\\|")</code>)
</p>

<p>
I have supplied several data files of varying sizes for you to work with.  (Don't download them to your CS account, see below.)
</p>

<ul class="padded">
    <li><tt><a href="http://cs.oberlin.edu/~gr151/imdb/imdb.cslam.txt">imdb.cslam.txt</a></tt> - a 11 line file with the example from the prelab</li>

    <li><tt><a href="http://cs.oberlin.edu/~gr151/imdb/imdb.small.txt">imdb.small.txt</a></tt> - a 1817 line file with just a handful of performers (161), fully connected</li>

    <li><tt><a href="http://cs.oberlin.edu/~gr151/imdb/imdb.top250.txt">imdb.top250.txt</a></tt> - a 14339 line file listing just the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/chart/top">top 250 movies</a> on IMDB.  (Disconnected groups of foreign films.) </li>

    <li><tt><a href="http://cs.oberlin.edu/~gr151/imdb/imdb.pre1950.txt">imdb.pre1950.txt</a></tt> - a 966338 line file with movies made before 1950</li>

    <li><tt><a href="http://cs.oberlin.edu/~gr151/imdb/imdb.post1950.txt">imdb.post1950.txt</a></tt> - a 6848516 line file with the movies made after 1950</li>

    <li><tt><a href="http://cs.oberlin.edu/~gr151/imdb/imdb.only-tv-v.txt">imdb.only-tv-v.txt</a></tt> - a 2021636 line file with only made for TV and direct to video movies</li>

    <li><tt><a href="http://cs.oberlin.edu/~gr151/imdb/imdb.no-tv-v.txt">imdb.no-tv-v.txt</a></tt> - a 5793218 line file without the made for TV and direct to video movies (best for the canonical Kevin Bacon game)</li>

    <li><tt><a href="http://cs.oberlin.edu/~gr151/imdb/imdb.full.txt">imdb.full.txt</a></tt> - all 7814854 lines of IMDB for you to search through</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Rather than cluttering up your account with these files, you can either use
    the links above for URLs.  Also, once you have your lab folder created, you
    can run <tt>151lab10setup</tt> from a lab machine and you'll get
    symbolic links to the files in the current directory.
    <em>Don't submit the imdb files when you handin the assignment.</em>
</p>


<p>
    Other than the small database, you'll almost certainly need to increase the
    amount of memory allowed via the <tt>-Xmx</tt> argument.
</p>

<h2>Commands to be supported</h2>
<p>
    Your program should read in the specified file and in the default case,
    choose "Kevin Bacon (I)" as the initial center.  There are a number of commands
    you are to support in order query the database and change the center.
</p>

<div class="specs">
<ol class="qpadded">
<li>
    <p>
        <b>find &lt;name&gt;</b> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Find the shortest path from the current center to
        <tt>&lt;name&gt;</tt>.  The output should be of the format
    </p>
    <pre class="code">    &lt;name1&gt; -&gt; &lt;movie1&gt; -&gt; &lt;name2&gt; -&gt; &lt;movie2&gt; -&gt; ... -&gt; Kevin Bacon (I) (n)</pre>

    <p>
        where &lt;name1&gt; is the person specified by the user and the movies
        and actors in between show the path from that actor to the current
        center.  The '(n)' should indicate the Bacon Number.  E.g., "find James
        Earl Jones" in the "full" database yields 
    </p>

    <pre class="code">    James Earl Jones -&gt; Magic 7, The (2008) (TV) -&gt; Kevin Bacon (I) (1)
    </pre>
    
    <p>
    and in the "no-tv-v" set:
    </p>

    <pre class="code">    James Earl Jones -&gt; Blood Tide (1982) -&gt; Mary Louise Weller 
            -&gt; Animal House (1978) -&gt; Kevin Bacon (I) (2)
    </pre>
    <!-- 
    James Earl Jones -> Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson (2004) 
        -> Billy Bob Thornton -> Sundance Skippy (2010) -> Kevin Bacon (I) (2)
    -->

    <p>
        Note that your links may differ, but the path length should be the same.
    </p>

    <p>If someone is disconnected from the center simply print</p>

    <pre class="code">    &lt;name&gt; is unreachable
    </pre>
</li>

<!-- 
<li>
    <p>
        <b>findall</b>

        on them.
    </p>
</li>
-->

<li>
    <p>
        <b>recenter &lt;name&gt;</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Change the center to the given name if it exists in the database.  If
        the name is not found, print an appropriate message and do not
        change the center.
    </p>
</li>

<li>
    <p>
        <b>avgdist</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    Calculate the average Bacon Number for the given center among all
    connected nodes.  Your output should be the following
    </p>

    <pre class="code">    &lt;avg&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;name&gt;&lt;space&gt;(&lt;number reachable&gt;,&lt;number unreachable&gt;)
    </pre>
    <p>
        The average should only be for the nodes reachable from the center.  In
        the top250 database, I get the following
    </p>

    <pre class="code">    3.5942556977039737  Kevin Bacon (I) (11803,663)
    </pre>

    <p>
        and in the "no-tv-v" set I get
    </p>
    <pre class="code">      3.003019238870945	    Kevin Bacon (I) (2221752,164815)

    </li>

    <li>
    <p>
        <b>topcenter &lt;n&gt;</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    For each actor in the current connected component (i.e., the one
    containing the current center), calculate the average bacon distance to all
    actors in that component.&nbsp; (NOTE: this can take a very long time on
    larger data sets.)&nbsp; Then print a table of the n best centers (i.e.,
    the ones whose average bacon distance is the smallest).
    </p>
    <p>
    Calculate the average Bacon Number for all entries in the
    database. NOTE: this can take a very long time on larger data sets.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the top 250 set, my program finds 
    "Robert Duvall (11803,663)"
    is the best center  (~2.699) 
    and the worst center is 
     "Kumeko Otowa (11803,663)" (~6.378).
    </p>

<h3>Additional commands</h3>
<p>
    You may opt to include additional other commands for consideration towards
    extra credit.  For any additional commands you implement, you should
    document them in the README file.  Be sure to explain what it does and how
    someone could use it.
</p>

<p>
    Here are some suggestions
</p>

<ol class="padded">
    <li><b>findall</b> - Iterate through all actors and actresses and perform a find operation on them.</li>

    <li><b>most</b> - list the actor with the most film credits (i.e., the actor vertex with the highest degree)</li>

    <li><b>longest</b> - print out one of the longest paths to the center</li>

    <li><b>movies &lt;name&gt;</b> - list all outbound edges from a given name</li>

    <li>Present the user with a menu to pick from if the IMDB file cannot be
        opened.  Just give the user text descriptions of the data sets and have
        the URLs stored in your program. </li>
    <!-- 
    <li>Saving and restoring state via a serializable object</li>
    -->
</ol>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
The longest Bacon Number I found in the 'imdb.no-tv-v.txt' dataset for Kevin
Bacon was 9 ("Andrea Parlato" and others).  "Kevin&nbsp;Bacon&nbsp;(I)" has an
average distance value of ~2.994 while "Sean&nbsp;Connery" has ~2.955
indicating that he is a better center than Kevin Bacon.  The Oracle of Bacon
has a top 1000 list of centers which could be used to search for better values.
</p>

<h3>Programming Tips</h3>
<p>
As we have been discussing graphs, It should be no surprise that a good way
to represent these acting relationships would be through a graph.  There
are a number of ways in which this can be done, however, if you want to
maintain a simple graph you might want to have both movies and actors be
vertices and the edges simply being relationships between them.
</p>

<p>
While an undirected graph could be used, the resulting path length will be
double the Bacon Number.  You would need to divide the path length by 2 or
use weights of 0.5 for the edges. Another technique would be to create a
directed graph and weight the paths from actors to movies as 0 and movies
to actors as 1.  Then, using Dijkstra's algorithm, you can find the
shortest path where all actors and actresses that are listed for a movie
can be consider equally.
</p>

<p>
Remember that it is best to build and test your program incrementally.
Construct your Graph class and be sure to include test cases in the main
method.
</p>

<p>
    If you decide to either use or model part of your implementation off of
    what is in the book, be sure to give proper credit in the methods or
    comments at the start of the file.
</p>

<p>
You can improve your results by appending a "(I)" to a name and retrying
the operation if it isn't found in the database before giving up.  (IMDB
has been adding that to the end of a number of entries.)
</p>
